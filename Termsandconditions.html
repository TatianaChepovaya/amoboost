        <p class="terms__text">
          These terms and conditions (“Terms”, “Agreement”) are an agreement between WowVendor.com (located at Clifton
          House, Fitzwilliam Street Lower, Dublin, Ireland) online website (“WowVendor”, “us”, “we” or “our”) and you
          (“User”, “you” or “your”). This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the
          https://WowVendor.com website and any of its Services (collectively, “Website” or “Services”).
        </p>
        <h3 class="terms__title-secondary">Age requirement</h3>
        <p class="terms__text">
          You must be at least 13 years of age to use this Website. By using this Website and by agreeing to this
          Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 13 years of age.
        </p>
        <h3 class="terms__title-secondary">Billing and payments</h3>
        <p class="terms__text">
          You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in
          effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. If, in our judgment, your purchase constitutes a
          high-risk transaction, we will require you to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo
          identification, proof of address, and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card
          used for the purchase. We reserve the right to change services and service pricing at any time. We also
          reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel
          quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by
          or under the same customer account, the same PayPal account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the
          same billing address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you
          by contacting the e-mail and/or other contact information provided at the time the order was made.
        </p>
        <h3 class="terms__title-secondary">Refund policy and cancelations</h3>
        <p class="terms__text">
          If we did not manage to complete your order in the specified time terms, you have the right to request a
          refund, or we may refund the money in our own discretion. You have the right to cancel your order and ask for
          a full refund at any time before the start of the service. You have the right to cancel your order after the
          start of the service and ask for a partial refund. In this case, the amount of the refund will be proportional
          to the volume of the unfinished services. (For example: if your order 10 mythic dungeons and decide to cancel
          the service after 7 dungeons are fully completed, you will receive a partial refund for 3 dungeons left. The
          amount of the refund will be 30% of the initial payment).
